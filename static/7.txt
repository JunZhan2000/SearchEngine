David Datuna: Artist eats $120,000 banana art at gallery
Georgian-born American artist David Datuna has eaten a banana used in an art work by Maurizio Cattelan, which had sold for $120,000 (Â£91,000).

The artwork, titled Comedian, was on display at Art Basel in Miami, one of the world's most high-profile art fairs.

The banana was swiftly replaced and no further action will be taken against Datuna - who said eating the banana was his "art performance".
